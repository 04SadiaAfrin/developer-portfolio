            <p>I am a person who is positive(negative) about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do,
                to see, and
                to
                experience. I like to read, I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to
                see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to smell the wind coming
                from
                the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like flowers in spring, rain in
                summer, leaves in autumn, and
                snow in winter.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>When one Sleeps, some people more than others are more likely than others to dream, with closed eyes they
                view different ideas and images. These Dreams can also be manifested as sensations and varying emotions.
                Dreams are not bound by anything, it can be opposite from the life one leads.</p>
