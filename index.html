            <p>I am a person who is positive(negative) about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do,
                to see, and
                to
                experience. I like to read, I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to
                see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to smell the wind coming
                from
                the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like flowers in spring, rain in
                summer, leaves in autumn, and
                snow in winter.</p>
